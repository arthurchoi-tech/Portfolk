This Portfolk WebApp (PortfolioSharingWebsite) is for COMP2068-Assignment 2b
The live URL is: 

The optional feature that I incorporated into my app is file upload. 

In this application, user will be able to share their portfolio(s) with other users. Only registered user will be able to post a new portfolio. Only the author will be able to edit/ delete their own portfolio (they won't see the buttons if they are not the author). For categories, all users can only view but not add/ edit. Only admin will be able to do so.
