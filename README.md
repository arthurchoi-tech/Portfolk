This Portfolk WebApp (PortfolioSharingWebsite) is for COMP2068-Assignment 2b
The live URL is: portfolk.azurewebsites.net

The optional feature that I incorporated into my app is file upload. 

Previously I was trying to build a MEAN webapp for the assignment but it turned out much more complicated than I thought. As a result, a new app using express-hbs is built in place of the original MEAN app: https://github.com/ka-wai-choi/PortfolioSharingWebsite

There are more than 4 commits in total for both MEAN and express-hbs app. I first built MEAN app from 10-Aug (Thu) and replace it entirely with express-hbs app on 13-Aug (Sun): https://github.com/ka-wai-choi/Portfolk
